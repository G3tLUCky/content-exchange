# content-exchange
This is a readme-file for the Master Thesis: The Content Exchange (under the supervision of Chris van der Lee). 
The aim of this thesis is to create a Natural Language Generator that generates texts regarding to Covid-19 in the Netherlands,
e.g. the amount of people who are infected per day, the number of hospital admissions (including admissions on Intensive Care) per day and the amount of deceased people per day.

This project tries to follow the same structure as a NLG which has been created by Chris van der Lee in order to generate soccer reports with a human tone of voice.
Therefore, the first step is to collect (the appropriate amount of) data on which the NLG can be tested. However, Munzert, Rubba, Mei√üner, and Nyhuis (2015) also suggest to define the variables first before deciding where to look for data.

Taking this into account, some important variables for the current system are:
-The daily and total number of Covid-tests
-The daily and total number of Covid-infections
-The daily and total number of hospital admissions, including admissions on the Intensive Care and admissions in regular clinics.
-The daily and total number of new people who passed away due to Covid-19
-The daily and total number of vaccines
